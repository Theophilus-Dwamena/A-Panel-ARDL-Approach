# A-Panel-ARDL-Approach [^1]
Climate change’s effect on agriculture is a severe problem in every society, particularly in West Africa. The rising temperatures and extreme weather events have significant implications for food security. In this study, we examine the effects of CO2 emissions, agricultural advancements, and food availability on economic growth in West Africa from 1990 to 2020,  using a panel ARDL approach with data from 14 countries. The analysis evaluates both long- and short-term effects, with the Dynamic Fixed Effects (DFE) estimator chosen as the most robust model. 

### Data
The data utilized for this study is secondary data for fourteen West African countries from 1990 to 2020. The following West African countries were part of the study: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, the Gambia, and Togo. Mauritania and Liberia were excluded to maintain data integrity due to missing values. The data was sourced from the World Bank’s Climate Change Knowledge Portal(CCKP) [^2] and World Development Indicators (WDI) database [^3]. The dependent variable is the GDPC.
The natural logarithm transformation was applied to the variables using the formula y = ln(x) , where x is the original variable value and y is the transformed value. This transformation controlled the influence of extreme values [^4].

### Empirical model
